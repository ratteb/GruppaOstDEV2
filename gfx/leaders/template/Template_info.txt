READ THIS BEFORE MAKING ANY PORTRAITS! IF YOU USE GIMP READ BELOW THIS! 

1. When you make a portrait, find a suitable, quality image that matches the size of the other ones used. Install a software like GIMP and cut out the image properly  to make it a PNG. 
2. When that is done, export the image as a PNG and copy the template.dds into the country file for the country leader (in GFX to be percise)
3. After you copied template.dds into the country file make sure to rename THAT file (not the one within template) to the desired character name. 
4. When that is done, import the PNG into paint.net and open the template. 
5. Make a new layer, and press ctr+c on the other tab with the PNG
6. Paste it onto the template, and station the PNG correctly until it looks good. 
7. Merge both layers before you do any kind of editing. 
8. Click on 'edit' and click on accents and shadows, when clicked press in these values: Accents -4 Shadows 100, brightness 83, radius 10.00
