 news_test.1.t:0 "Russian State Duma Collapses"
 news_test.1.d:0 "As many expected the transition of power to go smooth in Russia, the State Duma had completely collapsed, with numerous leaders of the Duma calling for its dismantlement, making the Duma practically useless. Reports on the ground show numerous armed groups have already sprung up in an attempt to take charge of the nation, with a Duumvirate of Shoigu and Gerasimov having marched on Moscow with armoured vehicles, such as the BMP, BTR and T-90's quickly taking the largest centers in the Russian Federation. \n\nLeader of Novorossiya, Denis Pushilin has said Novorossiya will forever stand by Russia, and will not be intimidated by Western sabouteurs trying to weaken its legitimacy. Thus, they proclaim support for the Duumvirate. Numerous international statements call for an intervention to Russia, possibily militarily, as the situation may casue a complete societal collapse of the 'Russian World' and all the countries in its influence. \n\nAnother report shows that the Communist and Nationalist forces have combined to create a large coalition to threaten the central government, causing many more to believe a civil war is only imminent, and nothing good will come from this."

 news_test.2.t:0 "Communist Forces Establish Control over Moscow!"
 news_test.2.d:0 "What many thought wouldnt be possible, just became a reality. The National Patriotic Alliance, made up of mostly Communists and Nationalists have marched on 4 of the most important cities in Russia, after the Liberal forces mysteriously dissapeared and the Duumvirate forces were greatly defanged of their power. Quickly, a mix of angry civilians, demonstraters, militiamen and defectors marched on important strategic sites in Sevastopol, such as its port, holding the entire Crimean peninsula hostage. \n\nThen, forces quickly captured Rostov, in a way to connect the Crimean forces and the Moscow contingent in a quick and decisive maneuver. The bulk of the Communist forces moved onto Moscow, capturing the Kremlin with Shoigu and Gerasimov being nowhere to be found. Airports were secured and any resistance that could be mustered fell flat due to tight air controls and the capture of the strategic air command systems. \n\nSt Petersburg fell not soon after. The Duma is now controlled by the "National Patriotic Committee" and have said their first act will be to dismantle the "Oligarchic and Putinist system of opression" having given a glimmer of hope in some eyes of the Western powers. A vote for a new president is planned to be held soon."
