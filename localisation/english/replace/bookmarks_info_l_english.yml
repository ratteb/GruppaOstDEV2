SOV_2027_DESC:0 "The Russian Federation, also know as the Russkiya Federatsiy is in a tough position in 2027. The Special Military Operation within the Novorossiya Region has ended, and a peace agreement was settled after the coup of Zelenskyy. Even with peace established, relations between Ukraine and Russia remain very tense, with diplomatic negotiations practically being off the table and there being no economic co operation either. Russia itself is in a decent spot, with sanctions being practically unaffected on their economy, and the Ruble being stronger than it was in early 2022 and late 2021. Vladimir Putin however is also growing in age, and may have to bring a successor to the Russian Federation soon. Whoever that may be, he will make sure Russia is in good hands."
