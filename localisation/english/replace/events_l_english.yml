 placeholder.1.d:0 "It was early in the morning, the time had passed and something was happening in the usual manner. Even with ongoing events taking place nearby, mostly interruptions but sometimes even unexpected occurrences affecting the usual routine, the situation remained steady. It had been difficult during the previous period to maintain stability, and there was finally some progress after everything that had taken place. Supplies were coming in as expected, and it was fortunate that circumstances had allowed for continuity, avoiding disruptions that could have caused further difficulties.\n\nIt was now later in the day, and a break had arrived. Conditions had improved over time, but one particular issue still persisted—the recurring signals and alerts. Even after a significant duration had passed, they continued to sound. It had become such a normal occurrence that there was no longer any reaction when they went off, usually signifying minor incidents that resulted in some level of disturbance. But as the moment continued, the sound returned once more. There was no rush to take precautions, as this had happened countless times before. However, this instance was unlike the one from before, and certainly different from those prior. It was, in fact, something far more significant. As there was no immediate concern, the impact was felt suddenly, an overwhelming force that changed everything. Just as realization set in, an event took place that left no chance for response. The occurrence lasted for some time before finally concluding. What remained afterward was only the remnants of what once stood.\n\nEfforts to address the aftermath took hours to complete, with reports detailing significant losses and numerous individuals affected. Among them was one specific person. As authorities worked to confirm everything, there was a responsibility to inform those connected, and the task ahead was not an easy one. But it was something that had been done before, and it would not be the last time it had to be done."

 novorossiya.1.t:0 "2014 All Over Again"
 novorossiya.1.d:0 "It was 7 in the morning, Christmas had passed and Evgeny was walking towards his work in the local industrial complex. Even with constant attacks coming from over the border, mainly missile attacks but sometimes even insurgents coming in and stealing some of the products and resources from the factory, his town was developing it was hard enough during the war in 2022 to make a living, and he was glad to finally see some improvement in his life after the end of the war. Resources were pouring in from Moscow like no tomorrow and he was lucky both his children and his wife was still alive, failing to get drafted during the war he was lucky enough to keep providing for his family even during the troubles of war.\n\nIt was 11 AM by now, and Evgeny had his lunch, work hours were much better now, but one damned issue remained, the constant air raid sirens. It seemed like even 2 years after this war was supposed to end the air raid sirens wouldnt shut up. He was so used to it now that he wouldnt even get afraid anymore when he heard them, they were usually small, minor missile attacks, that did some material damage but as he trying to eat his sandwhich, the alarm blared again. He took his time to get to the air raid shelter within the factory. But little did he realize that the attack from across the border wasnt like the one from 2 weeks ago, and not even the one that happened during Christmas. It was much, much worse. So as he was not worried, a barrage of explosions and shockwaves could be heard and felt. it felt much much more powerful. Just as Evgeny realized this was a very severe attack a missile directly hit the factory and he failed to get in the shelter. The missile attack lasted for another 10 minutes before seizing. This factory, was done. The only thing that remained of it was its sign: "Gruppa Paramed"\n\nThe cleanup operation took close to 4 hours to finish, and atleast 43 dead bodies were found, with hundreds more wounded and supposedly tens more trapped inside the shelter. Among the dead was one man: Evgeny. As the police confirmed all the dead and all the wounded, they had to come and bring the bad news to all family members, Yestov had a job on his hand, and this wouldnt be the first time he had to bring this news to people.

 novorossiya.2.t:0 "The Bad News"
 novorossiya.2.d:0 "As Yestov was starting his shift, today would mostly be telling poor families, widows, and children that their husbands, fathers, brothers, have perished in yet another missile attack. Yestov did not enjoy this job, but he had no choice did he? What else could they do? Bring them back? That wasnt an option. An impersonal letter? We arent demons. As he was in the transport vehicle going up to the first home and family, he could feel the sickness to his stomach, the sick feeling of having to tell these people their families have perished.\n\nHe walked up to the door, and gave a polite knock, as an older woman and a younger man opened the door he started speaking: "I am sorry to inform you. Your husband, Evgeny Povlov, has passed away. He did his best to save his brothers around him, but sadly he perished." He then handed the woman an envelope, with the info needed to plan the funeral, visit the body, and do all the nescessary bureaucracy. She started tearing up, he could see the pain in her eyes but he had to remain serious. Evgeny's wife ran back into her home, with the younger man being left to talk to the officer. "Thank you, officer, for letting us know. Do they know the cause?" Yestov took a deep breath and opened his mouth again. "It is either directly by the explosion, or, crushed by ruble. You will have to ask the morgue. Im sorry. Within that envelope there is compensation." The young man didnt want to accept it, his own father killed by a bunch of Azovite pricks. "Thank you, officer." He closed the door, and Yestov returned to his vehicle... "

 novorossiya.3.t:0 "Ukrainian Partisans Organize"
 novorossiya.3.d:0 "It was a long night, however as the construction of the Russian Dome of Freedom has begun, and the new Russian Government has decided to stabilize and start integrating the territory of Novorossiya more, the Azov Brigade within the territory of Ukraine has sent secret letters, and online messages recruiting, mainly older Ukrainians, to organize partisan cells and grow them. While the Russian Government has done their best to increase the quality of life, and increase the economic prosperity in the region, many cells of nationalism for Ukraine, and influence from Azov remain. \n\nIt is only a matter of time before they expand a great amount. And while they do remain small, the Russian Government will have to spend increasingly more resources trying to put them down and supress them."
