What followed were brutal crackdowns on our people, bombings of civilian centers, genocides, ethnic tensions and much more. However, even when Ukraine announced its Anti Terrorist Operation we endured and resisted. Our independence was established in 2015 but even then the Kiev regime continued to bomb our people. The very fact of this means we will never be able to unite under a pro Washington Ukraine."

This was our moment, the time our people would finally see freedom. However, what was thought to be a quick Special Operation was quickly thwarted by the generals in Washington. Sending lethal aid and money to the Kiev regime in order to slow the Russian Federation. But even as the enemies of the Russian Federation kept fighting, and kept pumping money into the war machine, the Russian Federation had won, with many cities destroyed, countless of deaths, and terrible issues for years to come, the people of Novorossiya are finally free. While the Special Military Operation was successful, the people never want such a thing to happen again."
