 NOV_denis_pushilin_desc:0 "Denis Pushilin has been the president and leader of the Donetsk People's Republic since 2014, when the country gained its independence from Ukraine. Denis has since then led Donetsk until the 2022 intervention in Ukraine, when then the Novorossiya region was officially annexed into Russia, however the reality remained complex and the Novorossiya region remained as a highly autonomous republic within the territory of Russia, making it semi independent to a point. Denis Pushilin is now the head of the Autonomous Republic of Novorossiya, or the People's Republic of Novorossiya. He is well respected by many, but also hated by many. His rule is to be seen on its effectiveness on a larger region, except this time Russia has his back."

 UKR_ihor_palytsya_desc:0 "Ihor Palytsya was the governor of Odesa from 2014 til 2015, and the chairman of the Volyn Oblast Council from 2015 til 2019, however he has chosen a different path, to lead the Za Maybutnye party after the victory of Russia in 2025, he was one of the leading figures in the snap election in August 2025 and has been tasked with dealing with numerous crisis' the massive insurgency, the economic depression and the failures of the SBU and other police services. The party has since 2024 dropped its pro europeanism view after it realized Russia would win the war, and Ihor wished to preserve a chance at even being allowed to run in elections anymore. In the last 2 years Ihor has mainly done his best to stabilze the country and make sure it doesnt collapse into a total civil war, but now his main problem is the massive insurgency that keeps growing as the ineffeciency of the SBU being able to deal with it shows itself. Ihor knows he will likely not win a re-election, but all he hopes for is to have a chance at saving his beloved country."
