 SOV_sotnik1_announcement_desc:0 "2 Years after the victory in the Special Military Operation, Vladimir Putin and the Ministry of Defense have drawn up the plan and opened the budget to announce the Sotnik-1 Modernization Program, looked to overhaul the equipment, tactics, and status of the Russian Armed Forces. Many issues were noted with the Armed Forces, the Gerasimov Doctrine was proven to be too ineffective to secure a quick victory in Ukraine, and has cost us a lot of Russian lives in the process, we need to make a choice to scrap this doctrine or renew it to make it effective enough. And we must remind ourselves to always be ready for a war with the collective west!"

 SOV_review_officer_corps_desc:0 "What we have realized in the many years of war, is that the Russian Armed Forces, and more specifically the Russian Officer Corps is plagued by corruption, and other major issues. The Ministry of Defense has ordered a nation wide review and inspection of the Officer Corps in order to get rid of underpreforming officers, corrupt officers, and those that do not comply with the standards of the Russian Armed Forces, those in charge of Contract Soldiers will be more harshly punished and investigated than others, as they are our main force ready to defend the Motherland."

 SOV_officer_corps_reform_desc:0 "We have realized in the wake of the Special Military Operation, that our Officer Corps is lackluster, we have a choice in the matter on either following Gerasimov's plan of inserting the widepsread NCO system, which will give us more flexibility on the field, and allow us to reorganize quickly, or we can follow the plans of the old guard and continue with the Reserve Officer Corps, which prioritizes strategical levels of organization and movements in a big force. Whichever we choose, we must make sure it is the right one, lest our army gets defeated and emberassed in a major war."

 SOV_NCO_system:0 "Introduce NCO System"
 SOV_NCO_system_desc:0 "After careful consideration, the Ministry of Defense, with the approval of President Vladimir V. Putin, has chosen to impliment the plans and strategies of Valery Gerasimov, and introduce the NCO system, decomissioning a lot of our reserve officers, and immediately beginning the training and review of new Non Comissioned Officers within our combat units, giving them more freedom to make orders, move around, and divert from the central command. Allowing for quick decisions to be made on the field. The West is not one step ahead!"

 SOV_expand_reserve_officer:0 "Expand Reserve Officer System"
 SOV_expand_reserve_officer_desc:0 "With the size of the Russian Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defense and Vladimir Putin had decided that the strategical level is much more important, and that a large reserve officer corps can solve the lack of strategical command expertise, while this does sacrifice liberties of the individual units, the army as a whole will have much more cohesion and organization, leading to a large, decisive and organized force. This however has once again proven the influence the Old Guard has over Putin and the Ministry of Defense..."

 SOV_memories_of_chechnya_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n£memories_of_chechnya_texticon \n\n\n\n\nIn 1994 the First Chechen war began, with Russian conscript troops crossing the borders of the illegal regime in Chechnya, however what followed was horror, many military deaths of conscript soldiers, humanitarian crisises, and a total emberassment of the Russian Army which got bogged down by a group of rag tag militants. In the end Yeltsin signed a peace agreement with Chechnya which secured their independence. Many lessons were learned from that war, where not to use armoured vehicles, and how to conduct better armed operations in urban centres like Grozny, but also mountains in the rest of the Republic. In 1999 with Putin as Prime Minister, and Yeltsin as President, after a significant terrorist attack by Islamic militants the Russian Federation once again invaded Chechnya in what is known as the Second Chechen War. From 1999 until 2000 the Second Chechen war raged, and a counter insurgency is what remained after, with countless of deaths, terrorist attacks, and controversies, mainly during the counter insurgency period. A big lesson learned is the trauma from using conscripts in military operations. Therefore, unless completely nescessary §Rwe dont use conscripts in any of our military conflicts.§!"
