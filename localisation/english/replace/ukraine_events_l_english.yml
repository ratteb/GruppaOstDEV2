 news_ukraine.1.d:0 "Hungarian Authorities located in Zakarpattia have reported a large scale mobilisation of Ukrainian forces on the Zakarpattian border. \n\nThe Ukrainian government has thrown accusations at the Hungarians of rigging referendum processes on the territory of Zakarpattia. An alleged conspiratorial effort to annex the region as part of Hungary and to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine. \n\nA large scale mobilisation was noted, over 50,000 troops in just a couple of days. Sensing the extreme rise of tensions within Ukraine and near the border of Hungary, western analysts re-assured people that war remains unlikely due to the current ongiong crisis in Ukraine and the general weakness of the Ukrainian army. \n\nEven with the re-assurance, Hungary has put their troops on high alert due to the unwillingness from Ukraine to negotiate a peaceful outcome, and instead relying on intimidation tactics and mobilisation."

Ukrainian troops started shelling Hungarian army positions, with soon after Ukrainian soldiers quickly crossing the border into Zakarpattia, engaging the Hungarian forces who have already dug in in the mountains and are expecting aid from their homeland to come soon enough. \n\nThe referendum process has been cancelled, Military Commander Farkas Sandor has exclaimed 'Until the threat of the enemy has been neutralized.' \nEarly engagements already show the Ukrainian army storming Hungarian positions, and local settlements with great speed and aggression. However, after a small contingent of Ukrainian soldiers were captured by the Hungarian army, they reportedly said 'We were forced to fight! We didnt want this war! We have no choice!' The Ukrainian government has denied any and all allegations and has repeated that all soldiers in Zakarpattia are volunteers, and all will return home within 30 days. \n\nWhether this will be true, is to be seen."

 news_ukraine.5.d:0 "The Ukrainian Government has declared victory in Zakarpattia, with the last fighting finally being done, and much of the destroyed 5th Brigade of the Hungarian Army fleeing into Hungary, with Farkas Sandor seen leaving by armoured vehicle in the early mornings. Within only 30 days Ukraine has established victory over Zakarpattia, and has subsequently called for a referendum to join Ukraine to be held the next month. \n\nMany analysts expected this to happen, due to limited NATO support for Zakarpattia, and Hungary having too much strain on their economy and people to keep fighting in Zakarpattia. A medium amount of Ethnic Hungarians were also seen crossing the border into Hungary to flee what they see as Ukrainian opressors. \n\nA victory parade was quickly held in the local capital, and order has been restored."
